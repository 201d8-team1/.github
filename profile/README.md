# Purpose
BlueWave Tech Solutions was created as as course project. The members of our group are currently enrolled at [CodeFellows](https://www.codefellows.org/) in the Cyber Security program. This is our  group final project for the 201 course.

# Scenario

Our client is Harest Haven is a local grocery store chain that is transitioning ownership. 
The new owners want to implement a modern tech infrastructure that was previously non-existent. 
The client was using an antiquated paper and cabinet filing system.

Computer file sharing was conducted via email.
The client also requested to have a cloud server setup in preparation for future projects including a new Point Of Sale system to replace thier current system.

# Solutions

- Our team implemented a secure internal network utilizing the features of pfSense.
- We created A custom Windows 10 Pro ISO file pre-configured with all the required safety features and included productivity software as well as antimalware software.
- We implemented backup solutions and file sharing via Microsoft One Drive.
- We set up a Linux server on AWS for future needs of the client.
